# upliance-ai-assignment

I did the assignment using two tools i.e. Python and Excel.

In Python I did Data Preprocessing i.e. checking the data types, if there are null values present. And then the merge the data and also did analysis to find out popular dishes using Matplotlib and Seaborn. 

And then did majority of my work in Excel using Power Query again to check data types and if null values are present or not. Then using power pivot analyze the data and also build stunning visualization which tells the story of data.

Now coming to the recommendation part:

1.Well there were some canceled order status. We need to dig deeper to get insight into why it got canceled. Did it got canceled while prepaaring the food or after preparing the food and why it got canceled is it beacuse they find it boring or were out of ingredients. 
Based on this we can make further decision to avoid canceled order status in future.

2. We can add a new feature in the product i.e. 'Dineout' just like Swiggy where we can add recipe food like if the user want to make food for a date or what if for potluck or what if guest are arriving and want to cook a quick meal for the people. So such category we can add where the user will find the product more fun and engaging.

3. Last but not the least what if we add a one more feature where AI will clean the vessel automatically by adding water and dishwasher liquid
